v0.4.1
*   fix incorrect installer version number
v0.4.0
*   the device model (GW1000/GW1100) is now identified via the API so many
    references to 'GW1000' in console and log output should now be replaced
    with the correct device model
*   when used as a driver the driver hardware_name property now returns the
    device model instead of the driver name (GW1000)
*   reworked processing of queued data by class Gw1000Service() to fix a bug
    resulting is intermittent missing GW1000 data
*   implemented debug_wind reporting
*   re-factored debug_rain reporting to report both 'WeeWX' and 'GW1000' rain
    related fields
*   battery state data is now set to None for sensors with signal level == 0,
    can be disabled by setting option show_all_batt = True under [GW1000] in
    weewx.conf or by use of the --show-all-batt command line option
*   implemented the --units command line option to control the units used when
    displaying --live-data output, available options are US customary
    (--units=us), Metric (--units=metric) and MetricWx (--units=metricwx)
*   --live-data now formatted and labelled using WeeWX default formats and
    labels
*   fixed some incorrect command line option descriptions
*   simplified binary battery state calculation
*   socket objects are now managed via the 'with' context manager
*   fixed bug when operated with GW1100 using firmware v2.0.4
*   implemented limited debug_sensors reporting
*   implemented a separate broadcast_timeout config option to allow an
    increased socket timeout when broadcasting for GW1000/GW1100 devices,
    default value is five seconds
*   a device is now considered unique if it has a unique MAC address (was
    formerly unique if IP address and port combination were unique)
*   minor reformatting of --discover console output
*   WH24 battery and signal state fields are now included in the default field
    map
v0.3.1
*   fixed error when broadcast port or socket timeout is specified in
    weewx.conf
*   fixed bug when decoding firmware version string that gives a truncated
    result
v0.3.0
*   added the --units command line option to allow the output of --live-data to
    be displayed in specified units (US customary or Metric)
*   added support for WH35 sensor
*   when run directly the driver now distinguishes between no sensor ID
    response and an empty sensor ID response
*   reworked battery state, signal level and sensor ID processing to cater for
    changes to battery state reporting introduced in GW1000 API v1.6.0 (GW1000
    v1.6.5 firmware)
*   The GW1000 cumulative daily lightning count field is now included in driver
    loop packets as field 'lightningcount' (the default field name). Previously
    this field was used to derive the WeeWX extended schema field
    'lightning_strike_count' and was not included in loop packets.
*   fixed incomplete --default-map output
*   fixes loss of battery state data for some sensors that occurred under
    GW1000 firmware release v1.6.5 and later
v0.2.0
*   added support for WH45 sensor
*   improved comments in installer/wee_config inserted config stanzas/entries
*   sensor signal levels added to loop packet
*   added --get-services command line option to display the GW1000 supported
    weather services settings when driver is run directly
*   added --get-pm25-offset command line option to display GW1000 PM2.5 sensor
    offset settings when driver is run directly
*   added --get-mulch-offset command line option to display GW1000
    multi-channel TH sensor calibration settings when driver is run directly
*   added --get-soil-calibration command line option to display GW1000 soil
    moisture sensor calibration settings when driver is run directly
*   added --get-calibration command line option to display GW1000 sensor
    calibration settings when driver is run directly
*   renamed --rain-data command line option to --get-rain-data
*   renamed various 24 hour average particulate concentration fields
*   added a check for unknown field addresses when processing sensor data
v0.1.0
*   initial release
